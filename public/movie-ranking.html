  <h3>Mission Mangal</h3>
  <p>
    Is about the Indian Mars Mission and how we managed to send it in such low
    budget. And is about the determination and hardwork of our scientists who
    made it possible in half of the time.

    This movie is about poor actions lead to poor results and the how right
    choice of action changes the life drastically resulting into very positive
    outcomes.
